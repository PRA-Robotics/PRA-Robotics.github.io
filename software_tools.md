# Software applications for PRA Robotics team members

## Slack communications
We use the [Slack appplication](https://slack.com/) for real time, team and coaches communications on a daily basis. 

The application is available for free and executes on the web, or for IOS and Android phones.

## Autodesk Fusion 360 CAD
We use the [Fusion 360 application](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview#) for computer aided (3D) design (CAD) which we then print with team 3D printers. 

The application is available for free and executes on the web, for Windows and Mac systems. 

Fusion 360 is available for free for educational use.

## GitHub source code control
We use [GitHub application](https://github.com/) for source code control and to host the Java and Blocks source code for our various robots. Source code control is a key skill for any software development that involves multiple team members and collaboration.

We also use GitHup to create our website.

The GitHub application is available for free and executes on the web, in a desktop version for PC/Windows and Mac and in conrol line input for every operating system. 

## Atom IDE
We use the [Atom Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://atom.io/) application to develop Java code for our robots 

Atom is available for free and executes on PC/Windows, Mac and Linux environments. 

## Java programing language
We use [Java coding language](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) to control the robots. The Java code must be built on FTC robot phones. There is an OnBot Java environment used to build and execute the Java code for FTC Robots.

## Google Blocks coding language
We can use (Google Blockly) [Blocks coding language](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) to control the robots. The Blocks language we use has been heavily modified to support FTC robot API. It's only available on in an FTC program environment running on a FTC App phone.

There is an OnBot Blocks coding environment that is used to build and execute Blocks code

# Google Drive, Docs and Sheets
We use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) to host all non-code team documentation, design, engineering notebook files. Many of these are developed in [Google Docs](https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en_us/products/docs/) or [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/). 

Some of our design files can be in Fusion 360 (for 3D printed parts) and for the overall robot design. 

Google Docs and Google Sheets are free and operate mostly on the web but there are also applications for IOS and Android devices. 

Contact us for an invitation to access the teams Google drive.
