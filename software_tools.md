# Software applications for PRA Robotics team members

## Slack communications
The PRA Robotics team uses the [Slack appplication](https://slack.com/) for real time, team and coaches communications on a daily basis. 

The application is available for free and executes on the web, or for IOS and Android phones.

At last count we have 9 Slack channels. Contact the coaches or another team member to get an invite to any or all of them. 

## Autodesk Fusion 360 CAD
The PRA Robotics team uses the [Fusion 360 application](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview#) for computer aided (3D) design (CAD) which we then print with team 3D printers. 

The application is executes on the web, for Windows and Mac systems. 

Fusion 360 is available for free for educational use.

## GitHub source code control
The PRA Robotics team uses [GitHub application](https://github.com/) for source code control and to host the Java and Blocks source code for our various robots. Source code control is a key skill for any software development that involves multiple team members and collaboration.

GitHub is also used to create the PRA Robotics website.

The GitHub application is available for free and executes on the web, in a desktop version for PC/Windows and Mac and in conrol line input mode for just about every operating system known to mankind. 

## Atom IDE
The PRA Robotics team uses the [Atom Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://atom.io/) application to develop Java code for our robots 

Atom is available for free and executes on PC/Windows, Mac and Linux environments. 

## Java programing language
The PRA Robotics team uses thu [Java coding language](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) to control the robots. The Java code must be built on FTC robot phones. There is an OnBot Java environment used to build and execute the Java code for FTC Robots.

## (Google Blockly) FTC Blocks coding language
The PRA Robotics team uses the (Google Blockly) [Blocks coding language](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) to control the robots. The Blocks language we use has been heavily modified to support FTC robot API. It's only available on in an FTC program environment running on a FTC App phone.

There is an OnBot Blocks coding environment that is used to build and execute Blocks code

# Google Drive, Docs and Sheets
The PRA Robotics team uses [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) to host all non-code team documentation, design, engineering notebook and other files. Many of these are developed in [Google Docs](https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en_us/products/docs/) or [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/). 

Some of our design files are developed using Fusion 360 for 3D printed parts and for the overall robot design. 

Google Docs and Google Sheets are free and operate mostly on the web but there are also applications for IOS and Android devices. 

Contact us for an invitation to access the teams Google drive.

# ftc_http OnBot build and file management tool
[ftc_http](https://ftcforum.usfirst.org/forum/ftc-technology/60134-ftc_http-a-utility-for-syncing-files-between-computer-and-onbot-java) is a PRA Robotics developed tool that is used to do upload, download and clear files from FTC robot phones. The ftc_http application also provides a mechanism to do java builds on FTC robot phones. 

The ftc_http operates on Mac (terminal), Windows (command line) and Linux and can be found [here](https://github.com/TheLostLambda/ftc_http) an GitHub repository.
