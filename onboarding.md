## New Team Member Onboarding Process

Incoming team members should complete the following steps to get up to speed.

## Highest Priority
* Ask a current student or coach to 'invite' you to join the slack workspace [more details](./communications.html)
* Read and fill out the student [Safety Agreement Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DEZTf5IYDHbeY0EzAF4iQCYHgVSQjJzW6hGhu74798E/edit?usp=sharing) *review/sign with your parent/guardian*
* Start attending PRA Robotics team meetings.  Ask lots of questions and start getting 'hands-on' with some hardware or software.

Team meetings are held 
* After school on Tuesdays & Thursdays until 5pm, in Mr. Caswell's room, next to the library upstairs
* Saturdays from 9:30-Noon in Mr. Caswell's room


## Next Priority
* Watch last [year's reveal video](https://youtu.be/rR4gR4l2XA8?t=128) to get a sense of how the FTC games work 
* Skim through the [Game Manual](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/game-and-season-info) to get an idea of the competition rules and the judging criteria (pay special attention to the Engineering Notebook section).
* Read through the [Blocks Tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial) to get an idea for how the robots get programmed to do what they do on the field.  For a deeper dive, move on to the [Java Tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/OnBot-Java-Tutorial) next.

## More Stuff
* Create a GitHub account and connect to [our GitHub source code repositories](https://desktop.github.com), although this isn't necessary as one can use the command line tool to upload/download and commit code. There's also [GitHub YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides) that you can watch.
* Register for an [educational Fusion 360 account](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators)
Once you're setup and have Fusion 360 installed, follow along [this CAD Tutorial](https://youtu.be/A5bc9c3S12g) to learn how
to start modeling parts that can later be 3D printed and installed on the robot!
* Download [Atom IDE](https://ide.atom.io) and you can watch [LevelUp Tutorial on Atom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyG20hhON6E)
