# Prospect Ridge Academy (PRA) Robotics
PRA is a STEM school in Broomfield Colorado.  The PRA Robotics team has been active for over 5 years in FTC and other robotics contests in the Denver and Colorado areas. Each school year we recruit new members and old (veteran) members return to tackle the [First Tech Challenge (FTC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) latest game.

# PRA Robotics team meetings
We generally meet every Tuesday and Thursday after school, during the school calendar year. We also meet on Saturday mornings ~9:30-Noon during the school year. We usually take a break after the state competition held in late winter early spring. And we honor all school vacation schedules.  

PRA Robotics meetings are held in Mr. Caswell's computer science classroom on the 2nd floor, near the library at PRA.

We hold recruitment activities after school starts for the year. But Robotic team meetings are open and anyone can join the team at anytime during the school year. We encourage any student with an interest in math, sciences, computer sciences or other technologies to come and join the team.

# History
A PRA FTC team has gone to the state competition in 2018 and 2019 and in 2018 we came in 2nd in the state.

In 2019, because we had so many members, we split the team up into a Rookies and Veteran team.
