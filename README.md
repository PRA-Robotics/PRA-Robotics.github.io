# Prospect Ridge Academy (PRA) Robotics
PRA is a STEM school in Broomfield Colorado.  The PRA Robotics team has been active for over 5 years in FTC and other robotics contests in the Denver and Colorado areas. Each school year we recruit new members and old (veteran) members return to tackle the [First Tech Challenge (FTC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) latest game.

# PRA Robotics team meetings
The team meets every Tuesday and Thursday after school, as well as Saturday mornings ~9:30-Noon during the school year. Team meetings usually pause after the state competition held in late winter early spring. Team meetings are not held during official school vacations unless there's been prior notice.   

PRA Robotics meetings are held in Mr. Caswell's computer science classroom on the 2nd floor, near the library at PRA.

Team recruitment activities are held after school at the start of the school year. But Robotic team meetings are open and anyone can join the team at anytime during the school year. We encourage any student with an interest in math, sciences, computer sciences or other technologies to come and join the team.

# History
A PRA FTC team has gone to the state competition in 2018 and 2019 and in 2018 we came in 2nd in the state.

In 2019, because we had so many members, we split the team up into a Rookies and Veteran team.
